## Finding The Best Place for a New well For a Mining Company

**This project shows;**
- ability to use existing libraries to build machine learning models.
- ability to take into account all the business conditions
- ability to use Bootstrapping technique.
- ability to avoid code duplication
- ability to suggest the best region for well development and justify the choice.
- ability to keep to the project structure and keep the code neat

**The project involves:**
- Collecting the oil well parameters in the selected region: oil quality and volume of reserves.
- Building a model to predict the volume of reserves in the new wells.
- Picking the oil wells with the highest estimated values.
- Picking the region with the highest total profit for the selected oil wells.
- Giving findings about the task study

## Data description
*id* — unique oil well identifier\
*f0, f1, f2* — three features of points (their specific meaning is unimportant, but the features themselves are significant)\
*product* — volume of reserves in the oil well (thousand barrels).

## Task
As a Data Scientist for the OilyGiant mining company, I'm required to build a model that will help to pick the region with the highest profit margin and analyze potential profit and risks using the Bootstrapping technique.

## Libraries Used
_pandas numpy sklearn matplotlib_
