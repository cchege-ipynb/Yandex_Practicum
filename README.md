Analyzing borrowers’ risk of defaulting  |To find out if a customer’s marital status and number of children have an impact on whether they will default on a loan. The bank already has some data on customers’ credit worthiness. The results of the research will be considered when building a credit score model that assesses the potential borrower's ability to repay a loan.|pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn

Determine whether a game succeeds or not in video game advertising campaigns|While working for the online store Ice, which sells video games all over the world. User and expert reviews, genres, platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation), and historical data on game sales are available from open sources. There's need to identify patterns that determine whether a game succeeds or not. This will allow one to spot potential big winners and plan advertising campaigns.The dataset contains the abbreviation ESRB. The Entertainment Software Rating Board evaluates a game's content and assigns an age rating such as Teen or Mature.|pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scipy, seaborn|

Developing a Model to pick the right plan for the subscribers of a Telecom Company|Mobile carrier Megaline had found out that many of their subscribers were using legacy plans. They wanted to develop a model that would analyze subscribers' behavior and recommend one of Megaline's newer plans: Smart or Ultra.The task is to develop a model that will pick the right plan.The threshold for accuracy should be 0.75 using the test dataset.|pandas and sklearn|

Predict whether a customer will leave the bank soon|Beta Bank customers are leaving: little by little, chipping away every month. The bankers figured out that it’s cheaper to retain the existing customers rather than to attract new ones. We need to predict whether a customer will leave the bank soon. The data on clients’ past behavior and termination of contracts with the bank has been provided. We need to build a model with the maximum possible F1 score of at least 0.59 for the test set. There's also need to measure the AUC-ROC metric and compare it with the F1.|pandas, sklearn.model_selection, sklearn.ensemble, sklearn.tree, sklearn.datasets, sklearn.utils, sklearn.metrics|

Building a Gold Extraction and Purification Model|To prepare a prototype of a machine learning model for Zyfra. This is a company that develops efficiency solutions for heavy industry. The model should predict the amount of gold recovered from gold ore using the data on extraction and purification provided. It should also assist in optimizing the production and elimination of unprofitable parameters.|pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scipy, sklearn.model_selection, sklearn.linear_model, sklearn.tree, sklearn.ensemble, sklearn.metrics|

Developing a data transformation algorithm that would make it hard to recover personal information|It's necessary to develop a data transformation algorithm that would make it hard to recover personal information if the data fell into the wrong hands. This is called data masking, or data obfuscation. But the data should be protected in such a way that the quality of machine learning models doesn't suffer. There's no need to pick the best model, just to prove that the algorithm works correctly.|pandas numpy sklearn|

Developing an app to attract new customers to a Used Car Sales Service|Rusty Bargain used car sales service is developing an app to attract new customers. In that app, one can quickly find out the market value of a car. With access to historical data: technical specifications, trim versions, and prices. We need to build the model to determine the value considering the quality, speed and time taken to train the model|pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scipy, sklearn.model_selection, sklearn.linear_model, sklearn.tree, sklearn.ensemble, sklearn.metrics, sklearn.datasets, lightgbm, catboost|

Predict the amount of taxi orders for the next hour for a Taxi Company|Sweet Lift Taxi company has collected historical data on taxi orders at airports. To attract more drivers during peak hours, we need to predict the amount of taxi orders for the next hour. Build a model for such a prediction. The RMSE metric on the test set should not be more than 48.|pandas, statsmodels.tsa.seasonal, sklearn.model_selection, sklearn.utils, sklearn.linear_model, sklearn.tree, sklearn.ensemble, sklearn.metrics, matplotlib|

To train a model to automatically detect negative reviews for classic movie enthusiasts|The Film Junky Union, a new edgy community for classic movie enthusiasts, is developing a system for filtering and categorizing movie reviews. The goal is to train a model to automatically detect negative reviews. We'll be using a dataset of IMBD movie reviews with polarity labelling to build a model for classifying positive and negative reviews. It will need to reach an F1 score of at least 0.85.|pandas, numpy, matplotlib, spacy, seaborn, tqdm, sklearn.linear_model, TfidfVectorizer, sklearn.model_selection, sklearn.metricssklearn.metrics, nltk.corpus|

Using Data Science to adhere to alcohol laws by making sure no salesare made to people underage.|The supermarket chain Good Seed would like to explore whether Data Science can help them adhere to alcohol laws by making sure they do not sell alcohol to people underage. The following is in consideration:- The shops are equipped with cameras in the checkout area which are triggered when a person is buying alcohol- Computer vision methods can be used to determine age of a person from a photo.- The task then is to build and evaluate a model for verifying people's age|pandas, matplotlib, tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image|
